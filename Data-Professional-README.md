Data Professional Survey Breakdown Dashboard
Project Overview
This project delivers a comprehensive and interactive Power BI dashboard designed to analyze the global data professional landscape. Leveraging a survey dataset of over 600 participants, the primary goal was to uncover crucial trends and insights related to career progression, compensation, skill sets, and industry entry barriers within the data field.

Key Achievements
Interactive Dashboard Creation: Developed a dynamic Power BI dashboard (Data Professional Survey Breakdown Dashboard.pbix) that provides a visual and interactive interface for exploring survey data. Users can easily drill down into various metrics to gain deeper insights into the data professional ecosystem.

Key Trend Visualization: The dashboard effectively visualizes critical findings, including:

Average salaries across different data job titles (Data Scientist, Data Engineer, Data Analyst, etc.).

Participant happiness levels regarding salary and work/life balance.

Popularity of programming languages (Python, R, Java, JavaScript, C/C++) among various roles.

Geographical distribution of survey participants.

The perceived difficulty of breaking into the data industry.

Robust Data Transformation & Modeling: Raw survey data was meticulously cleaned and transformed using Power Query to ensure high data quality and usability. Advanced calculated measures were developed using DAX to support sophisticated analysis, enabling seamless drill-down capabilities by job title, region, and experience level.

PDF Export for Snapshot: A static PDF version of the dashboard (Data Professional Survey Breakdown Dashboard PDF.pdf) was generated, offering a shareable snapshot of key visualizations and findings for quick reviews or presentations.

What Was Done
Data Acquisition and Cleaning: Initial survey data was imported and processed using Power Query to handle missing values, inconsistencies, and format discrepancies, ensuring data integrity.

Data Modeling: Established robust relationships between different data tables within Power BI, building a comprehensive data model to facilitate thorough analysis.

DAX Measure Development: Authored complex DAX formulas to create calculated measures, enabling dynamic aggregations and comparisons across various dimensions (e.g., average salary per job title, satisfaction scores).

Dashboard Design and Visualization: Designed a user-friendly and aesthetically pleasing dashboard in Power BI, utilizing a variety of chart types (bar charts, gauge charts, pie charts) to present insights clearly and effectively.

Technologies Used
Power BI: For dashboard creation, data modeling, and visualization.

Power Query: For data acquisition, cleaning, and transformation.

DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): For creating advanced calculated measures and supporting analytical capabilities.
